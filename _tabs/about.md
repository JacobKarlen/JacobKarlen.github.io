My name is Jacob Karl√©n and I'm a final year M.Sc. student in Computer Science and Engineering (Civ.ing Industrial Engineering and Management). Welcome to my personal blog where I post about things that interest me and projects I'm working on. This mainly includes everything related to data, finance and the intersection in-between.
